# WYSIMOO
A learnig project by Julian Shepherd to recreate MOO within Ruby


# Notes
Almost all of the files required in wysimoo.rb are not meant to run by themselves.

Thanks to whoever wrote the $room:go() code on MOO. I got the MOO version of the code used in the Room.go method at www.hayseed.net/MOO/manuals/LambdaCoreProgMan.html#SEC5. When you go there, after scrolling down a bit, you should see something like this: 

Verb: none go (list args)
    The verb is a player command used to move from one room to another. One special feature of. . .

After some text, there should be some code, which is kind of the MOO version.
